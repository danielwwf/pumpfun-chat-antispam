**For streamers, traders, and degens. Keep your chat clean while you focus on the charts! 🚀**

> **🔒 SECURITY:** Not a wallet drainer! No data theft! 100% safe! Don't trust us? Drop the code in ChatGPT/Claude/Grok and ask them! It's open source - verify it yourself!

## What This Bad Boy Does 💪

This Chrome extension is your personal bouncer for PumpFun chat. It automatically detects and nukes those annoying `@fightrugs`, `@stoprugs`, and other rug-related spam messages that flood the chat when you're trying to ape into the next 100x.

**TL;DR:** It finds spam → highlights it → deletes it → bans the spammers. All automatically. You focus on the charts, we handle the spam.

## Features That'll Make You Cum 🍆

- **🎯 Smart Detection**: Catches `@*rug*` mentions (like `@fightrugs`, `@stoprugs`) plus legacy "stoprugs" spam
- **⚡ Four Action Modes**:
  - **Highlight Only** (safe mode - just shows what would be caught)
  - **Viewer Mode** (hide spam from YOUR view only - 100% safe, no rate limiting risk!)
  - **Delete via UI** (moderator mode - removes spam for everyone)
  - **Ban via UI** (nuclear mode - bans spammers with reason selection)
- **🔧 Customizable Delays**: 0.2s to 2s between actions (0.2s for lightning fast cleaning!)
- **🛡️ Race Condition Protection**: Processes one message at a time (no more broken UI)
- **🌊 Real-time Processing**: Catches spam as it arrives
- **🎛️ Easy Toggle**: Enable/disable without refreshing
- **🚨 Chat Health Monitoring**: Auto-refreshes page if chat dies (perfect for 24/7 operation)
- **🎯 Single-Tab Operation**: Only one tab processes spam (others stay dormant)

## 🔒 **Is This Safe? (YES! Here's Why)** 🔒

### **"Is this a wallet drainer?"** NO! 
### **"Does it steal passwords?"** NO!
### **"Is it malicious?"** NO!

**Don't trust us? GOOD! You shouldn't trust random extensions!** 

### **🔍 How to Verify It's Safe:**

1. **Ask AI to Review It:**
   - Download the code
   - Drop it into ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok
   - Ask: "Does this extension do anything malicious?"
   - They'll tell you: **IT'S SAFE!**

2. **Ask Your Dev Friend:**
   - Send them the code (it's only ~1000 lines)
   - They'll confirm: **No wallet access, no data theft, no BS**

3. **Review It Yourself:**
   - Open `manifest.json` - See what permissions we request
   - Open `content.js` - See exactly what it does
   - **ZERO external connections** (no data leaves your browser)
   - **ZERO wallet interactions** (doesn't even know you have one)

### **🛡️ What This Extension CAN Access:**
- ✅ **pump.fun website only** (see manifest.json - host_permissions)
- ✅ **Your trigger word settings** (stored locally in Chrome)
- ✅ **Chat messages on pump.fun** (to detect spam)

### **❌ What This Extension CANNOT Access:**

- ❌ **Your passwords** (no form access)
- ❌ **Other websites** (only works on pump.fun)
- ❌ **Your browsing history** (no history permissions)

### **📝 The Code is Simple:**
```javascript
// Literally all it does:
if (message contains spam) {
  if (viewer_mode) {
    hide_message();  // Just CSS: display = "none"
  } else if (delete_mode) {
    click_delete_button();  // Click the existing delete button
  }
}
```

### **🎯 Our Promise:**
- **100% Open Source** - Every line of code is visible
- **No external servers** - Everything runs locally
- **No data collection** - We don't even have a server

- **No monetization** - No ads, no tracking, no BS

### **💡 Pro Tip:**
If you're paranoid (and you should be in crypto):
1. **Review the code first**
2. **Run it in a separate browser profile**
3. **Use it without your wallet connected**
4. **Watch the network tab** - You'll see ZERO external requests

**TL;DR: We just put the fun back in pump.fun by hiding spam. That's it. That's the extension.** 🎉

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Setup for Streamers/Moderators Only!** 🚨

**If you're using Delete/Ban modes (moderators), you need to be strategic:**

### **🎯 Recommended Setup for Streamers/Moderators:**
- **Open TWO pump.fun tabs:**
  - **Tab 1**: For normal chatting, streaming, interacting (keep extension DORMANT here)
  - **Tab 2**: Dedicated for spam cleaning (let extension be ACTIVE here)
- **Why?** When the extension is actively deleting/banning, the UI gets busy and chatting becomes difficult

### **🎮 For Regular Users (Viewer Mode):**
- **Just use ONE tab** - Viewer Mode doesn't interfere with chatting!
- **No setup needed** - Enable Viewer Mode and chat normally
- **Clean experience** - Spam gets hidden from your view without UI interference

### **🟢 How to Set This Up (Moderators Only):**
1. **Open pump.fun** in your main tab (for chatting/streaming)
2. **Open SECOND pump.fun tab** (for spam cleaning)
3. **In the second tab**: Click extension icon → Should show "🟢 Active on this tab"
4. **In the first tab**: Click extension icon → Should show "⚪ Inactive (dormant)"
5. **Chat normally in first tab** while extension cleans spam in second tab

### **🚨 Alternative: Separate Browser/Profile**
**For complete isolation:**
- Use a dedicated Chrome profile or different browser (Firefox, Edge, etc.) just for the extension
- Install extension only in the spam-cleaning browser
- Keep your main browser clean for normal usage

**How to create a separate Chrome profile:**
1. Click your profile icon in Chrome → "Add Profile"
2. Set up a new profile just for spam cleaning
3. Install the extension only in that profile
4. Keep your main profile clean for normal usage

## How to Use (Ape Mode Activated) 🦍

### First Time Setup
1. **Install the extension** (see above)
2. **Go to pump.fun** 
3. **Refresh the page** (this is important after install!)
4. **Click the extension icon** in your toolbar
5. **Enable it** with the toggle switch
6. **Choose your action mode** (defaults to "Viewer Mode" - perfect for most users!)

### Settings Explained

**🎯 Action Modes:**
- **Highlight Only**: Just highlights spam messages (safe testing mode)
- **Viewer Mode**: Hides spam from YOUR view only (perfect for regular users!)
- **Delete via UI**: Automatically deletes spam messages (for moderators)
- **Ban via UI**: Deletes AND bans the spammer (nuclear option for mods)

**⏱️ Step Delay:**
- **Always 0.2s**: Lightning fast and optimized - no user configuration needed!
- **Not used in Viewer Mode** (hiding is instant)

**🔨 Ban Reason:**
- **Always "Spam"**: Simplified - no need to choose, everything gets nuked as spam!

### Usage Tips for Maximum Effectiveness 🔥

1. **Viewer Mode is default** - perfect for most users (hides spam from your view)
2. **Test with "Highlight"** first if you want to see what gets caught
3. **Switch to "Delete"** if you're a moderator (removes spam for everyone)
4. **Use "Ban"** for persistent spammers (nuclear option for mods)
5. **Lower delays** for faster mod actions (but watch for rate limits)
6. **Disable temporarily** if you need to moderate manually

### 🎯 **Viewer Mode - Perfect for Regular Users!**

**Don't have mod permissions? No problem!** Viewer Mode is designed for regular users who just want a clean chat experience:

**🔒 100% SAFE FROM RATE LIMITING:**
- **ZERO network activity** - Makes no requests to pump.fun servers
- **Pure CSS hiding** - Only sets `display: none` on spam messages
- **No background tasks** - No timers, intervals, or storage operations
- **Completely passive** - Can't trigger Cloudflare blocks
- **Use 24/7 safely** - Impossible to get rate limited!

**🔍 How Viewer Mode Works:**
- **Skips existing messages** - doesn't touch chat history when you join
- **Only hides NEW spam** - incoming messages that match your triggers
- **Your view only** - other users still see the spam (you don't)
- **No permissions needed** - just CSS hiding, no UI interactions
- **Instant hiding** - processes immediately without delays or batching

**👥 Perfect For:**
- **Regular chat participants** without mod permissions
- **Viewers** who want clean chat during streams
- **Traders** who want to focus on legitimate discussion
- **Anyone** who's tired of spam but can't delete it

**🚀 Usage:**
1. **Join any pump.fun chat**
2. **Set action to "Viewer Mode"**
3. **Existing chat stays visible** (you see the conversation context)
4. **New spam gets hidden** automatically as it arrives
5. **Enjoy clean chat** without affecting others!

**No more code editing!** Add your own trigger words through the built-in UI:

### **🎮 How to Add Custom Triggers:**
1. **Click extension icon** → Main popup opens
2. **Click "Manage Trigger Words"** → New window opens  
3. **Add triggers** (one per line):

5. **Changes apply immediately** - no page refresh needed!

### **🎯 Trigger Types:**
- **Simple words**: `scam`, `rugpull`, `fud`
- **Phrases**: `scam alert`, `obvious rug`
- **Username patterns**: `@fudders`, `@scammers`
- **Wildcard patterns**: `full*bundled*dont*buy` (catches any spacing/chars between words)
- **Exact phrases**: `exact:full bundled dont buy` (matches only exact phrase)
- **Regex patterns**: `@*rug*` (catches @fightrugs, @stoprugs, etc.)

### **💡 Pro Tips:**
- **Use lowercase** for better matching
- **Test with "Highlight" mode** first to see what gets caught
- **Start with defaults** then add your own
- **One trigger per line** in the text area
- **Changes are instant** - no refresh needed!

## Troubleshooting (When Shit Breaks) 🔧

### Extension Not Working?
1. **Refresh the page** (fixes 90% of issues)
2. **Check if it's enabled** (click the icon)
3. **Try a different action mode**
4. **Check browser console** for errors (F12 → Console)

### Messages Not Getting Deleted?
1. **Make sure you have mod permissions** on the chat
2. **Try increasing the step delay** (might be getting rate limited)
3. **Switch from "Ban" to "Delete"** (ban requires more permissions)
4. **Refresh the page** and try again

### Extension Seems Stuck?
1. **Disable and re-enable** it via the popup
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Check console logs** for error messages

### After Changing Settings?
- **Sometimes you need to refresh** the page after changing action modes
- The extension tries to handle this automatically, but if it acts weird, just refresh

## Technical Shit (For the Nerds) 🤓

- **Built for Manifest V3** (future-proof)
- **Uses MutationObserver** for real-time detection
- **Homoglyph normalization** (catches sneaky Unicode tricks)
- **Global processing lock** (prevents race conditions)
- **Automatic retry logic** (handles UI timing issues)
- **Zero external dependencies** (pure vanilla JS)

## Console Logs (Debug Mode) 🐛

Open browser console (F12) to see what's happening:
```
PF Auto-Mod found matching message: "least obvious rug lol..."
PF Auto-Mod starting delete_ui operation with 2000ms delay
PF Auto-Mod delete operation succeeded
PF Auto-Mod processing lock released
```

## Known Issues (Shit We're Working On) ⚠️

- **First install requires page refresh** (Chrome extension limitation)
- **Sometimes need refresh after changing modes** (working on it)
- **Ban mode needs proper mod permissions** (can't fix stupid)
